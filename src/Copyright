Clarification:
<p>

My view is that the GPL places no restriction on _using_ ploticus to produce 
graphs for any legal commercial, proprietary, public or private purpose,
but that the GPL prohibits someone from taking the ploticus code and selling 
it, or adding it into a larger software product that is to be sold or 
distributed to other parties as non-GPL software.  Software that's freely
distributed strictly within an organization for internal use only does not 
have to be GPL.  I take an active interest in seeing that these rules are 
adhered to, and request notification of any suspected violations - scg@jax.org
<p>

Exception for bundling as a reporting utility:
For situations where ploticus is to be bundled as an ancillary reporting 
utility along with a larger software package, I interpret GPL section 2 as 
requiring that GPL be attached only to ploticus, and not to the larger 
package.  Prerequisites: 1) the rest of your product must be considered an 
independent and viable work in its own right; 2) ploticus must be invoked 
using the standard pl(1) executable, not the libploticus API; 3) ploticus 
graphics capability may not be offered as an additional cost option; 
4) ploticus source code may not be enhanced; 5) ploticus identity and 
authorship must be clearly stated and be visible to users.
