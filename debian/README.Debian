ploticus for Debian
-------------------

The prefabs (templates for some common chart types) are installed
in /usr/share/ploticus.

In Debian, the ploticus binary is /usr/bin/ploticus.  Upstream
calls it pl, but there is a conflict with a package already part
of Debian, so this could not be used.

No support for any .gif format is provided in Debian.  Support
is offered for .ps, .eps, .svg, .svgz, .png, .bmp, .x11  files.
FreeType2 font support is also compiled in.

Locale support has been compiled in.

libploticus support is now offered by this source package.

I strongly urge that you install ploticus-doc. This package will
be hard to use without it.
