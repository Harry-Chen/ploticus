.SH GIF PATENT CONTROVERSY
.LP
Ploticus does not read GIF files.
Ploticus writes run-length-encoded (RLE) GIF files.
Our understanding is that these RLE GIF files do not 
use patented LZW compression.
.LP
Ploticus uses the miGIF package to produce RLE GIF output.
miGIF includes this statement:

The miGIF compression routines do not, strictly speaking, generate files
conforming to the GIF spec, since the image data is not LZW-compressed
(this is the point: in order to avoid transgression of the Unisys patent
on the LZW algorithm.)  However, miGIF generates data streams that any
reasonably sane LZW decompresser will decompress to what we want.

miGIF compression uses run length encoding. It compresses horizontal runs
of pixels of the same color. This type of compression gives good results
on images with many runs, for example images with lines, text and solid
shapes on a solid-colored background. It gives little or no compression
on images with few runs, for example digital or scanned photos.

.SH FUTURE OF GIF
.LP
At the current time the future of GIFs is clouded by 
the fact that the LZW patent holder requires
licenses for software that creates LZW GIFs.
.LP
In response there is currently an industry movement away from GIF,
in favor of PNG, which has superior compression and no red tape.
The only disadvantage with PNG is that old browsers
do not support it, and as time goes by, this problem will diminish.
.LP
Because of all this, PNG support has been added to ploticus as of
version 1.2, and GIF support, even though it is non-LZW, may be 
discontinued at some point in the future.
