Can ploticus be used as part of a commercial package or service?  The GPL 
does not allow ploticus code to be used within proprietary software that is to 
be distributed to others.  However, for cases where ploticus is included as a 
separate, distinct reporting utility within a larger package, I interpret GPL 
section 2 as requiring that GPL be attached only to ploticus, and not to the 
entire product.  For this to be allowed: 1) the rest of your product must be 
considered an independent and seperate work in its own right; 2) ploticus must 
be invoked as a distinct, separate executable; 3) ploticus graphics capability 
may not be involved as an option at additional cost; 4) ploticus source code 
may not be modified or enhanced, except for changes to the Makefile or similar 
as needed for configuration or packaging; 5) ploticus identity and authorship 
must not be obfuscated of omitted-- a prominent statement must be visible to 
users to the effect that "graphs are produced using the Ploticus data display 
program (c) 2002 Steve Grubb.  The Ploticus program is freely downloadable at 
http://ploticus.sourceforge.net".  I also request that you notify me out of 
courtesy at scg@jax.org, and include a URL for your product.  If you have 
questions or need clarification in this area just ask.
