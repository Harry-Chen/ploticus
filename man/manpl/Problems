.SH TROUBLESHOOTING
Here are some troubleshooting tips and common snafus:
.IP \(bu
Unix users should download gzip tar files.
Zip files are intended only for PC environments (text files have CR/LF line terminators).
.br
.br
.IP \(bu
Before compiling, review the \fBMakefile\fR and follow the simple 3-step 
installation guide.
.br
.br
.IP \(bu
An ANSI-compliant C compiler such as \fBgcc\fR is required to compile the source code.
.br
.br
.IP \(bu
After building, do a quick test.  From within the \fCsrc\fR directory type \fCpl stock.htm\fR.
For further testing see \fC pltestsuite \fR, or run some gallery examples.
.br
.br
.IP \(bu
If you get this error: \fCpl error 4899: No PLOTICUS_PREFABS env var (or hardcoded Makefile 
PREFABS_DIR) found\fR, it indicates that no default prefabs directory was specified
at build time and that each user must have the
\fBPLOTICUS_PREFABS\fR environment variable set and exported.
It must contain the full pathname of the directory where
ploticus prefabs reside, as included in the download.  
.br
.br
.IP \(bu
Be sure you know which version you are executing
(you might have earlier ploticus versions on your system and not realize it).
Use \fCpl -version\fR to print the ploticus
version; use the unix command \fCwhich pl\fR to print the file that you
are actually executing when you type \fCpl\fR.
.br
.br
.IP \(bu
Unix builds do not read native PC text files.  This problem occurs
if pl is compiled on a unix machine and you feed it native PC text files, 
either as scripts or data files.  
Symptoms may include truncated multi-line text
items, or garbage characters appearing at the end of text items.  
.br
.br
.IP \(bu
If an image result contains blank areas at the top or side, it is probably because
the image is larger than 8" x 8" in one or both dimensions.  To generate images larger than 
8" x 8" a sufficient \fBpagesize\fR must be specified, either on the command line or via 
proc page.  
.br
.br
.IP \(bu
If viewing result images in a browser, remember that image caching is usually
being done, and that you might not be seeing the most recently generated image,
even when you Reload or Refresh.

.SH BUG REPORTS
Much of the incremental improvement in this package has been due to
the careful bug reports that have been sent in by attentive users.  Thanks!
Bug reports should be sent to \fC

.LP
When reporting a problem, please supply the following info:
.IP 
\fB1.\fR the OS environment where you invoked pl (eg. linux, solaris, windows/NT, etc.)
.IP
\fB2.\fR \fC pl \fR version number (type \fC pl -version \fR to find out).
.IP
\fB3.\fR exactly how you invoke \fCpl\fR.  Using a prefab?  CGI mode?  By typing in a pl command?
Via perl or PHP?  With or without a config file?  Provide the exact pl command used.
Since there are now a number of possibilities,
this is especially important. 
.IP
\fB4.\fR a self-contained example that demonstrates the problem.  Usually the first thing
I do is attempt to reproduce the problem here.
