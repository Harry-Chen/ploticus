<br>
<h2>Version 2.02 - Jan 11, '02</h2>

<li> <a href="clickmap.html">HTML server-side imagemap support</a> has been added.
<br>
<br>
<li> The data parsing code has been rewritten, and now allows situations that 
weren't allowed before, 
such as blank fields (tab or .csv formats), and variable number of fields per row.  
The <a href="dataformat.html">dataformat documentation</a> has also been improved.
<br>
<br>
<li> new attribute - <a href="getdata.html">proc getdata</a> - <tt>nfields</tt> - Controls
the expected number of fields per record.  
<br>
<br>
<li> new attribute - <a href="getdata.html">proc getdata</a> - <tt>fieldnamerows</tt> - 
like <tt>fieldnames</tt> but allows data field names to be given one per line.
<br>
<br>
<li> modified attribute - <a href="getdata.html">proc getdata</a> - <tt>delim</tt> -
There is now a distinction between 
whitespace delimitation with quoted strings (<tt>spacequoted</tt>) and
pure whitespace delimitation (<tt>whitespace</tt>).
<tt>whitespace</tt> is faster, but the default remains <tt>spacequoted</tt>
(<tt>space</tt> for short) so that existing scripts don't break.
<a href="dataformat.html">More info</a>.
<br>
<br>
<li> new attribute - <a href="lineplot.html">proc lineplot</a> - <tt>gapmissing</tt> - allows missing data
points to cause a gap in the curve.  Similar parameter added to <b>lines</b> and <b>chron</b> prefabs.
<br>
<br>

<li> new attribute - <a href="scatterplot.html">proc scatterplot</a> - <tt>clustermethod</tt> - 
control how duplicate points will be clustered.
<br>
<br>

<li> new attribute - <a href="scatterplot.html">proc scatterplot</a> - <tt>symfield</tt> and <tt>symrangefield</tt> -
allows symbol shape, color, etc. to be controlled by a data field.
<br>
<br>

<li> new attribute - <a href="scatterplot.html">proc scatterplot</a> - <tt>dupsleg</tt> 
allows symbol shape, color, etc. to be controlled by degree of duplicity

<br>
<br>
<li> <a href="../doc/prefabs.html">prefabs</a> - added <tt> rectangle </tt> as a standard parameter.  
It controls plotting area size (and location, if rendering in paginated postscript).

<br>
<br>
<li> <a href="../doc/prefab_lines.html">lines prefab</a> - changed the way that 
the <tt> fill </tt> parameter works.  Previously
it had applied to all curves and line color was used.  Now it is specified 
as a color, and separately for each curve (using fill2, fill3, and fill4).
<b>Note: this will break any existing applications that use 
the lines prefab to render multiple filled curves</b>.

<br>
<br>
<li> The directory for <a href="../doc/prefabs.html">prefab</a> files can now be
hard-coded at build time, settable in the Makefile.  If this is done then users
don't need the PLOTICUS_PREFABS environment variable to be set.
This capability is not available on win32 builds.

<br>
<br>
<li> a new prefab called <a href="prefab_draw.html">draw</a> has been added.
It interprets ploticus draw commands.

<br>
<br>
<li> some new <a href="functions.html">functions</a>, including $numgroup() and $dategroup()
which are useful in grouping a set of numbers or dates into bins.

<br>
<br>
<li> the internal name lookup scheme for function names has been changed, and is now a 
little more efficient.
<br>
<br>
<li> fixed bug: <a href="bars.html">proc bars</a> - stacked bars are drawn incorrectly when minima is non-zero.
Eg. stacked vertical bars are incorrect if the plotting area Y min is non-zero.
<br>
<br>
<li> fixed bug: <a href="bars.html">proc bars</a> - stacked bars - clobber bug causing core dump on linux.
<br>
<br>
<li> fixed bug: datetime scaling - floating point rounding problem.  Came to light when
user tried to autorange on a datetime field and was getting a minima time of 06:59
when it should have been 07:00.
<br>
<br>
<li> increased the size of file pathname variables from 127 to 255 and doing length checking
on script file and output file name
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Version: 2.01 (16 Nov '01)</h2>
<font size=+1>New features:</font>
<ul>
<li> <a href="svg.html">SVG</a> capabilities.  The driver was written by Bill Traill.
<br>
<br>
<li> The Makefile has been reworked.  Before building ploticus you edit the
Makefile and follow a simple 3-step procedure.  There are more build variations than before.
<br>
<br>
<li> Source code can now be compiled on win32 using mingW and maybe other compilers.  
<a href="../doc/nonunix.html">More info.</a>
<br>
<br>
<li> postscript - ISO Latin1 encoding added, so that European characters may be produced
in postscript exactly like they are in the other environments (ascii 128-255).
<br>
<br>
<li> Created graphic files are automatically chmod'ed to mode 644.
</ul>
<font size=+1>Bug fixes:</font>
<ul>
<li> Some code problems related to the new CGI functionality have been cleaned up.  
These may have caused problems on some platforms.
<br>
<br>
<li> proc getdata filter - data field names within proc getdata filter statements were 
not working.  Fixed.
<br>
<br>
<li> dates - dates earlier than 1977 causing problems with autorange and
probably in other areas.  This has been fixed to handle dates back to Jan 1 1800.
<br>
<br>
<li> general - most command line args including var=value pairs were being retained in
a 200 character buffer, a problem when command lines are longer.  Fixed.
<br>
<br>
<li> proc bars - problems with bar labeling when select is used; also clustering should work 
with segment bars.  Fixed.
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Version: 2.00 (18 Sep '01)</h2>
<font size=+1>
This major release introduces
<a href="prefabs.html">prefabs</a> for creating standard types of plots
directly from the command line,
<a href="cgi.html">CGI mode</a>,
and optional JPEG, WBMP, and FreeType2 support.
The script interpreter code has been completely replaced;
a general clean-up pass was applied to all code.
<br>
<br>
Specific new features:
</font>
<ul>
<li><a href="prefabs.html">Prefabs</a> 
<br>
<br>
<li><a href="cgi.html">CGI mode</a>
<br>
<br>
<li> Optional JPEG, WBMP, and <a href="fonts.html">FreeType2</a> support, however you must link to 
your own copy of GD library version 1.84 
or higher when you build ploticus, and have the other required libs.  
See the Makefile for more info.  Thanks to Michael Tonkin for getting the ball rolling on this.
<a href="../gallery/stock.jpeg">Here's an example that uses a TrueType sans serif font</a>.
<br>
<br>
<li> A new script interpreter.
New <a href="scripts.html#directives">flow of control operators</a> including: 
<tt> #elseif #else #for #while #setifnotgiven #call #write #shell</tt>, etc.
Also, increased <a href="limits.html">capacities</a> for data fields and variables (250 chars)
and script input lines (3000).
<b>The new interpreter involves some <a href="changes20.html">script syntax changes
that may cause existing scripts to break</a> in some cases.</b>
<br>
<br>
<li>
General code clean-up and efficiency improvements
(thanks for the suggestions.. who wrote that code, anyway?!).
<br>
<br>
<li> <a href="sql.html">#sql</a>, a new directive for retrieving data directly from an SQL database.
This is currently under development,
and user-contributed client interfaces to DBMSs such as MySQL and Oracle would be welcome
(the code is in dbinterface.c)
</ul>
<font size=+1>A number of minor improvements and bug fixes are also present:</font>
<ul>
<li> Added: proc areadef <a href="autorange.html">autorange</a> - new subattributes 
<tt>selectrows</tt> (for selecting rows to be considered when
scanning for min and max) and <tt>combomode</tt> (to allow correct finding
of min and max for situations like error bars and stacked bars).
<li> Added:  proc areadef <a href="autorange.html">autorange</a> - now sets variables
DATAXMIN, DATAXMAX, DATAYMIN, and DATAYMAX - the actual minima and maxima of data field.
<li> Added: <a href="axis.html">proc axis</a> - <tt>stubevery</tt> attribute
<li> Added: <a href="getdata.html">proc getdata</a> - <tt>pathname</tt> attribute, to specify
data file name directly without involving cat(1) 
<li> Added: <a href="bars.html">proc bars</a> - <tt>colorfield</tt> attribute - set bar color based on a data field
<li> Added: <a href="legendentry.html">proc legendentry</a> - <tt>tag</tt> attribute 
<li> Added: various new <a href="functions.html">functions</a>
<li> Added: the temp file default path name and default slash character can now be changed in pl.h
or in a <a href="../doc/config.html">config file</a>.
<li> Added: resource utilization (cpu time and size of created disk files) now can be controlled.
Default upper limits are 10 cpu seconds and 5,000,000 bytes.
Limits may be altered in pl.h or by using a <a href="../doc/config.html">config file</a>
<li> Added: various other <a href="../doc/config.html">config file</a> settings
<li> Changed: proc axis - minor changes to avoid orphan date stubs and improper year placement (autoyears)
<li> Fixed bug: proc axis - when producing stubs running from negative to positive zero is displayed 
as a very tiny non-zero value such as 5.2579e-17 due to rounding error.  
<li> Fixed bug: proc getdata - buffer overflow when 'filter' is used with data records longer than 254 chars,
causing garbage result or instability.  
<li> Fixed bug: proc legend - legend entry text could not be adjusted using textdetails \fCadjust=\fR
<li> Fixed bug: proc bars - <tt>select</tt> omits bars but not labels.  Thanks to Dan Tsafrir for finding this one.
<li> Fixed bug: $arith() function - detects and issues an error on divide-by-zero.
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Ploticus is 2 years old - 25 Aug '01</h2>
<br>


<h2>Ploticus version 1.41: 18 Jun '01</h2>
<ul>
<li> Ploticus now covered under <a href="Copyright.html"><img src="../doc/gpl.gif" border=0></a>.
<br><br>
<li> proc bars - additional (diagonal) cross hatching available as an accessory (see <a href="../doc/Download.html">d
ownload page</a>)
<li> Fixed bug: colored background not completely filling the result window when scale
is being done
<br><br>
<li> Fixed scripts in test suite:
The change in default size (version 1.40) sometimes caused
general layout problems with graphics that were layed out with an 8.5" x 11" 
default size in mind.  The solution for these scripts is to add a #proc page and 
specify <tt>pagesize: 8.5 11</tt>.
Some of the scripts in the test suite had such problems and are now fixed.
<br><br>
<li> Fixed bug: EPS bounding box incorrect for 1) pltab output and 2) pl where result 
draws into negative absolute coordinate space.
<br><br>
<li> Fixed bug: proc areadef xautorange/yautorange not working correctly in some cases 
when a nearest= value is specified.  This bug was apparently introduced in 1.40.  
<br><br>
<li> Fixed bug: proc lineplot - accum option choking when non-numeric data encountered.
<br><br>
<li> Fixed bug: proc rangebar - negative barloc values not working.
<br><br>
<li> Added: proc areadef - autorange datafield may now be a comma-delimited list of dfields
so that multiple data fields are considered when determining the axis min and max.
<br><br>
<li> Changed: scaletypes - times hh:mm:ss and mm:ss - validity checking relaxed 
slightly to allow degenerate values such as 0:4:9
<br><br>
<li> Fixed bug: pltab - incorrect interaction between #font and sectionheadings
<br><br>
<li> Fixed bug: proc rangebar - textdetails controls N= label but not missing label 
<br><br>
<li> Fixed bug: pltab - creates 8.5 x 11 inch gif, png regardless of result size
<br><br>
<li> Fixed bug: axis - line grid and gridblock starting point incorrect in X
<br><br>
<li> Fixed bug: axis - colors incorrect when specified in certain combinations for tics, stubs, grid 
<br><br>
<li> Fixed bug: bars - ticks not being drawn when truncating was not switched on
</ul>

<h2><a href="../doc/Faq.html">FAQ</a> Sept 29 '00</b> Expanded and updated.</h2>
<ul>
Recently added questions are denoted as <b>NEW</b>.
Now includes some discussion of performance issues near the end of the document.
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Version 1.39: Sept 29 '00</h2>
<ul>
<li>Changed - proc transform renamed as proc processdata ('transform' still works)
<li>Changed - script syntax - references to undeclared @variables are now left alone.  
Formerly they had resulted in syntax errors.
<li>Added - proc areadef - autorange - if nearest= is omitted a reasonable default will be used 
for numeric data.  Formerly it defaulted to exact min and max, which was usually not desirable.
It is now possible to say nearest=exact to get exact min and max, should that be wanted.
<li>Added - proc areadef - categories - a new attribute called 'catcompmethod', to control the
details of how category comparisons are done.
<li>Added - proc areadef - now sets variables XMIN, XMAX, YMIN, and YMAX
<li>Fixed bug - proc areadef - autorange - problems with negative numbers; 
<li>Added - proc axis - 'stubs increment' with no following value gives a reasonable default increment.
So does 'stubs inc 0'.
<li>Added - proc bars - barwidthfield and bwfscale for data-driven bar widths
<li>Added - proc datesettings - several new options for omitting weekends
<li>Fixed bug - proc getdata - choking on long path names.  Increased sizes of many buffers
throughout.
<li>Fixed bug - proc getdata field names - a name beginning with a number such as 16kHz was being interpreted
as an integer field number.
<li>Added - proc processdata - new actions 'breaks' to do break processing on data sets, and related
action 'breakreset'.
<li>Added - proc rangebar - when using meanmode, plotfields may now be used for getting a mean, standard
deviation, and optionally an N value. 
<li>Changed - proc rangebar - variable NVALUES is now always set, even if nothing was plotted (it will be zero in this case).
<li>Added - proc rangebar - new attributes showbriefstats, showstatsfile, briefstatstag to make a
file holding computed statistical info that can be used by other programs
<li>Added - proc rangebar - allow 'none' for outliernearsym and outlierfarsym, for when displaying
outliers using only labels or line segments.
<li>Added - proc rangebar - a new attribute called 'skipmed', to omit median and percentiles calculation
when only means and standard deviations are needed (a performance consideration).
<li>Fixed bug - proc rangesweep - bug involving the use of 'select'
<li>Added - new function - $dataitem(), to access a single data item from the current data set by row 
and field position.
<li>Added - command line / proc page - the options -croprel and -crop
<li>Changed - ploticus temp file naming now uses shorter names
<li>Added - user-contributed RPM spec file.  See the Download page under Accessories.
<li>Changed - makefile & build - copied gd_io.h to the gd16 subdirectory for successful solaris 'make' build
<li>Added - MP/ix added to Makefile
<li>Changed - gallery example EPS or Postscript files will no longer be stored on the web site, except for the pltab examples.
<li>Changed - ploticus manual in postscript form will no longer be maintained or distributed.
</ul>
<br>
<br>

Workaround is to use pltab -o
<br>
<br>
<b>Version 1.37: May 24 '00</b>
<li>Added new proc - proc datesettings
<li>Added - an option to omit weekends with date or datetime scaling, via proc datesettings
<li>Improved - numeric data in scientific format e.g. 4.335e12 now supported
<li>Improved - #declare and #musthave now can take comma-delimited lists of variable names
<li>Fixed bug - proc bars, error bars not positioned correctly w/ clustering
<li>Fixed bug - proc rangebar, 1.5iqr mode, incorrect upper tail length
<li>Fixed bug - proc rangebar, zero length tail should not be drawn at all 
<li>Fixed bug - proc tabulate, entries should not be sorted when valuelist is used
</ul>

<li>Improved - postscript %%Creator and %%Title tags not used correctly
<li>Fixed bug - proc pie - line+label not working correctly on gallery example pie4.htm
<li>Improved - proc line - first coordinate pair should implicitly do a 'moveto'
<li>Added pltab -landscape option
<li>Added new function $max()
<li>Fixed bug - pltab centering of column stubs (had been left-aligned)
<li>Fixed bug - multi-page landscape postscript - 2nd page orientation was incorrect
